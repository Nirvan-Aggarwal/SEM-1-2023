   <h1>GOLCONDA FORT</h1>
   <p>
  Golconda Fort is a fortified citadel and ruined city located in the western part of Hyderabad, in present-day Telangana, India.The present structure, which was historically known as Qila Muhammadnagar, was built by the Qutb Shahi Sultans of Golconda, during the reign of the first three Sultans, Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk, Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah, and Subhan Quli Qutb Shah.
<br>
The origins of the Golconda fort can be traced back to the 11th century. It was originally a small mud fort built by PratƒÅparudra of the Kakatiya Empire. The name Golconda means "round hill" in Urdu, however, others say that Golconda is thought to originate from Telugu for "Cowherd's hill"
